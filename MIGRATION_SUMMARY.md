# Migration from localStorage to Supabase - Complete Summary

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Migration ✅

**FROM:** localStorage-based data storage
**TO:** Supabase PostgreSQL database

All data is now stored in a production-ready, scalable database with:
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- Real-time capabilities
- Automatic backups
- Full SQL support

### 2. Data Service Layer ✅

**Created:** `src/services/supabaseDataService.ts`

Replaced `src/services/dataService.ts` with a modern async service that:
- Uses Supabase client for all database operations
- Supports async/await patterns
- Handles errors gracefully
- Removes all localStorage dependencies

### 3. Stripe Integration ✅

**Created:** Supabase Edge Function at `/functions/v1/stripe-handler`

Features:
- Creates Stripe checkout sessions
- Handles payment webhooks
- Automatically generates license keys
- Syncs products to Stripe
- Sends notifications on purchase

### 4. Updated Components ✅

The following pages/components now use Supabase:
- ✅ `src/pages/Products.tsx` - Product listing
- ✅ `src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx` - Product details
- ✅ `src/pages/admin/Products.tsx` - Admin product management
- ✅ `src/pages/admin/Sales.tsx` - Sales campaign management
- ✅ `src/components/FeaturedProducts.tsx` - Homepage featured products

### 5. Environment Configuration ✅

**Created:** `.env.example` with all required variables:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```

6. **sales_campaigns** - Discount campaigns
7. **user_profiles** - Extended user information
8. **wishlists** - User wishlist items
9. **notifications** - User notification system
10. **admin_users** - Admin role management
